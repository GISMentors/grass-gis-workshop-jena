Unit 29 - PyWPS LST region stats
================================

A third version of the process will return LST statistics for region
in Germany defined by input vector (polygon) data. Input area of
interest is defined as ``region`` ``ComplexInput`` parameter
(:lcode:`9,18-21`) and imported by :grasscmd:`v.import` (line
:lcode:`53`), resultant statistics is computed similarly as in process
verion 1 (:doc:`27`) by :grasscmd:`t.rast.series` (line :lcode:`59`)
and :grasscmd:`r.univar` (line :lcode:`72`). Before computation the
computational region and mask is set by :grasscmd:`g.region`
(:lcode:`56`) and :grasscmd:`r.mask` (:lcode:`57`). Statistics is
provided in JSON structure similary to process version 2 (:doc:`28`)
on line :lcode:`83`.

Note that also class name (:lcode:`30`), process identifier
(:lcode:`32`), title (:lcode:`33`), abstract (:lcode:`38`) and version
(:lcode:`39`) needs to be updated.

.. important:: Do not forget to import process as done in :ref:`Unit 27
   <process-import>` and restart demo PyWPS server.

Copy :file:`jena_boundary.gpkg` to :file:`pywps-flask-master/static/data` and
execute the process.
