Unit 15 - Data reprojection
===========================

In this unit EU-DEM global dataset provided by `Copernicus programme
<https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/copernicus-land-monitoring-service-eu-dem#tab-gis-data>`__
will be used. Jena region is covered by tile E40N30. Be aware that
EU-DEM tiles covers large regions (4GB per tile).

Normally :grasscmd:`r.import` could be used to import and
automatically reproject data into target location. In our case there
is no need to import into GRASS a whole big DEM tile. By using ``-r``
flag of :grasscmd:`r.in.gdal` GRASS module only a subregion covering
AOI can be imported. Unfortunately :grasscmd:`r.import` do not offer
such flag. This is a reason why data will be reprojected
manually. Input data will be imported into a new location
(ETRS89-extended / LAEA Europe :epsg:`3035`). In the next step
imported data will be reprojected into target *jena-region*
(WGS 84 / UTM zone 32N :epsg:`32632`).

.. note:: In order to save disk space the original EU-DEM tile was
   clipped by larger region than Jena AOI. Modified tile is available
   from :file:`geodata/eu-dem` directory.

Create location for data import
-------------------------------

EU-DEM dataset is provided in ETRS89-extended / LAEA Europe
(:epsg:`3035`). Start a new GRASS session and create a new location
*jena-eu-dem* based on input :file:`geodata/eu-dem/dem_sample.tif`
file as described in :ref:`Unit 02 <create-location>`) or from EPSG code.

.. important:: Skip data import provided by
               location wizard since only subregion defined by Jena city region is
               planned to be imported.

Enter new location (PERMANENT mapset) and copy (ie. reproject)
:map:`jena_boundary` into the current location.

.. _data-reproject-fig:

.. figure:: ../images/units/15/data-reproject.png
   :class: middle
           
.. figure:: ../images/units/15/data-reproject-1.png
   :class: middle
           
   Copy :map:`jena_boundary` vector map from `jena-region` location
   (:epsg:`32632`) to the current location (:epsg:`3035`).

.. figure:: ../images/units/15/data-reproject-dialog.png
   :class: small
           
   Reprojection and default maximum segment must be confirmed.
   
.. note:: The same operation can be done by :grasscmd:`v.proj`:

   .. code-block:: bash
                          
      v.proj location=jena-region mapset=PERMANENT input=jena_boundary

Before importing DEM set computation region extent based on
reprojected Jena city region.
      
.. figure:: ../images/units/15/region-extent.png
   :class: large
	   
   Set computational region extent based on Jena city region.

Launch :grasscmd:`r.in.gdal` (:menuselection:`File --> Import raster
data --> Import of common raster formats`) to import DEM tile, don't
forget to enable :option:`-r` flag.

.. code-block:: bash

   r.in.gdal -r input=geodata/eu-dem/dem_sample.tif output=dem 

.. figure:: ../images/units/15/dem-imported.png
   :class: middle
           
   Imported DEM limited to current region extent. Visualized using
   ``elevation`` color table.

Reproject DEM into target location
----------------------------------

Now switch back to *jena-region* (target) location (PERMANENT mapset).

.. _switch-location:

.. figure:: ../images/units/15/switch-location.png
   :class: middle
	   
   Switch to jena-region location and PERMANENT mapset from
   :item:`Data` tab.

Reproject DEM from *jena-eu-dem* location by copying in :item:`Data`
tab. Set desired resolution (25m) and choose appropriate resampling
method (in our case *bilinear*).

.. note:: If a mask is enabled, it's good idea to remove it before
   importing.

.. figure:: ../images/units/15/data-reproject-raster.png
   :class: small
	   
   Reproject raster data by specifying target resolution and
   resampling method.
  
.. note:: The same operation can be done by :grasscmd:`r.proj`:

   .. code-block:: bash
		
      r.proj location=jena-eu-dem mapset=PERMANENT input=dem method=bilinear resolution=25

.. figure:: ../images/units/15/dem-3d.png
   :class: large
	   
   Imported DEM in 3D view. Jena city region by blue color.
