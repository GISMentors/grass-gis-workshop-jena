Unit 07 - QGIS loves GRASS
==========================

Let's step out of the GRASS GIS for a moment. **QGIS** is a very
popular open source GIS package which made a significant progress in
the last years. Nowadays it's used in education, academic environment,
but also in commercial settings. The project started originally more
or less as a multiplatform browser for geospatial data. This is not
true any more, QGIS made important steps for being an analytic
tool. Beside native algoritms QGIS offers also connection to external
software packages like SAGA, Orfeo or GRASS GIS. In other words, you
can run GRASS tools from QGIS without starting GRASS explicitly.

There two options how to access GRASS tools from QGIS environment:

* generic **Processing** plugin
* specialized **GRASS** plugin

Both plugins can be easily activated from :menuselection:`Plugins -->
Manage and Install Plugins`.

Let's focus on our "favorite" GRASS module - :grasscmd:`i.vi`. At
first, we load into QGIS input data, Jena city region and Sentinel
bands (red and near-infrared channels).

.. figure:: ../images/units/07/qgis-input-data.png
   :class: large
           
   Input data loaded in QGIS.

Processing plugin
-----------------

Processing plugin is a generic toolbox which allows to run processing
tools provided by various software packages. Let's open
:menuselection:`Processing --> Toolbox` and search for
:grasscmd:`i.vi` GRASS module.

.. figure:: ../images/units/07/processing-i-vi.png
   :class: small
           
   Search for :grasscmd:`i.vi` GRASS module in Processing toolbox.

.. figure:: ../images/units/07/processing-i-vi-params.svg
   :class: middle
                    
   Set input parameters. Computation extent can be defined in Advanced
   parameters section.

:numref:`processing-result` nicely shows how Processing plugin
works. First of all a temporal GRASS location is created by
:grasscmd:`g.proj`, input data are linking into this location by
:grasscmd:`r.external`. Then computation can finally starts by running
:grasscmd:`i.vi` module. In the last step output data are exported out
of GRASS using :grasscmd:`r.out.gdal`. The resultant GTIFF file is
displayed in QGIS map window.

.. _processing-i-vi-running:

.. figure:: ../images/units/07/processing-i-vi-running.png
           
   Running tool, most of time takes exporting data outside of GRASS
   temporal session.
   
.. _processing-result:

.. figure:: ../images/units/07/processing-result.png
   :class: large
           
   Resultant NDVI raster displayed in QGIS map window (with better
   color interpretation than grayscale). No clouds mask involved.

GRASS plugin
------------

GRASS plugin has been designed to support GRASS as *native* processing
toolbox.  This also includes ability to display data stored in GRASS
native format, raster and vector maps located in GRASS locations. And,
of course, ability to run any GRASS command with full flexibility of
GRASS environment. On the other hand, in contrast to **Processing**
plugin, the GRASS plugin requires at least basic knowledge of GRASS
GIS. User have to understand concept of locations and mapset, and
control computational region. Data created by GRASS plugin are
persistent and accessible also by GRASS itself.

GRASS plugin behaves similarly to GRASS itself. In order to use GRASS
tools, there must be a location and a mapset available to be
entered. New location/mapset can be created by :menuselection:`Plugins
--> GRASS --> New Mapset`. Creating new mapsets in GRASS plugin is a
very similar procedure to creating location/mapset in native GRASS
environment, see :ref:`Creating new location <create-location>` (Unit
02). Since we already have GRASS location and mapset prepared from
:doc:`02`, we can easily open it by :menuselection:`Plugins --> GRASS
--> Open Mapset`.

.. figure:: ../images/units/07/grass-open-mapset.png
   :class: small
           
   Open existing location and mapset by GRASS plugin.

After opening existing mapset, the GRASS tools are activated 
accessible from menu :menuselection:`Plugins --> GRASS --> Open GRASS
Tools`.

As advanced GRASS users, we know that before any computation desired
computational region must be defined. For this task, GRASS plugin
offers GUI tool in :item:`Region` tab. In any case, for more advanced
operations can be used :grasscmd:`g.region` GRASS module.

.. figure:: ../images/units/07/grass-region.svg

   Set computation region from map display. Don't forget to set
   correct spatial resolution (for real work it's better to use
   :grasscmd:`g.region` with `align` option).

Simply launch :grasscmd:`i.vi` from **GRASS modules** tab.

.. todo:: add screenshot
          
.. tip:: GRASS modules can be launched from **GRASS Shell** as shows
         the figure below.

   .. figure:: ../images/units/07/grass-shell.png
        
      Start a GRASS Shell.

   By adding a special flag :param:`--ui` to the end of command, a
   native GRASS GUI dialog appears. In this way you can start other
   GRASS tools like :grasscmd:`g.gui.gmodeler` (see :doc:`08`) or
   whole GRASS GUI by :grasscmd:`g.gui`. But it seems schizophrenic a
   bit to start GRASS GUI from GRASS plugin in QGIS
   environment. Someone can ask, why don't you use GRASS directly
   ;-)

   .. figure:: ../images/units/07/grass-i-vi-shell.svg
      :class: large
           
      Launch native GUI dialog for :grasscmd:`i.vi` GRASS module.

.. note:: NDVI can be alternatively computed using
   :grasscmd:`r.mapcalc`, and well-known map algebra technique.

   .. figure:: ../images/units/07/grass-r-mapcalc.png
      :class: small
   
      Search :grasscmd:`r.mapcalc` module in GRASS plugin.

   GRASS plugin offers native graphical front-end for map algebra.

      .. figure:: ../images/units/07/grass-map-calc.png

         Graphical Map Calculator in GRASS plugin.

Resultant output data are stored in current mapset open by GRASS
plugin. Native GRASS data can be directly accessed by QGIS *Browse
Panel* in normal way as other data sources, see
:numref:`qgis-grass-browser`.

.. _qgis-grass-browser:

.. figure:: ../images/units/07/grass-data-browse.png
   :class: large
        
   Browse GRASS data similarly as other data sources.
