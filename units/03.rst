Unit 03 - Data Management
=========================

Data can be imported simply from toolbar in :item:`Data` tab by tools
dedicated for :wikipedia:`raster <GIS_file_format#Raster_formats>`
|grass-raster-import| or :wikipedia:`vector <GIS_file_format#Vector_formats>`
|grass-vector-import| GIS data formats. Basic knowledge of commonly
used :wikipedia:`GIS file format` is required.

.. note:: GRASS terminology differs from commonly used GIS
   packages. To avoid confusion let's focus on the most
   important terms. Commonly used term "a layer" is called in
   GRASS "a map". While GRASS layer is a subset of features within
   one "map". So "GRASS raster map" can be treated as "a raster
   layer" in other GIS packages.

Data used in this unit is located in :file:`sentinel/sample`
directory of a sample dataset.

Raster data
-----------

Let's import sample Sentinel-2 4th band
:file:`L2A_T32UPB_20170706T102021_B04_10m.jp2` file.  Data is stored
in :wikipedia:`JPEG2000` data format, which is nowadays commonly used
GIS *raster* format for imagery data. Raster data can be imported into
GRASS from the toolbar |grass-raster-import| :sup:`Import raster data
[r.import]` or from the menu :menuselection:`File --> Import raster
data --> Simplified raster import with reprojection`.

Import dialog allows importing single raster file (:item:`File`) or
multiple files from directory (:item:`Directory`). In our case single
file is planned to be imported.

.. _import-raster:

.. figure:: ../images/units/03/import-raster-dialog.png

   Select input raster file to be imported.

.. figure:: ../images/units/03/display-band4.png
   :class: large

   Imported raster data is automatically displayed in *Map Display*
   window. Progress of import is shown in :item:`Console` tab.
   Default color table is not perfect as you can see, color
   interpretation will enhanced in :ref:`Unit 04 <color-table>`.
           
.. note:: GRASS imports/links RGB image as separate bands. Color
   composition can be displayed using :grasscmd:`d.rgb`.
   
.. _raster-metadata:
  
Basic raster metadata can be printed by :grasscmd:`r.info` or from
:item:`Layers` tab.

.. figure:: ../images/units/03/raster-metadata.png

   Show raster metadata from contextual menu.

.. figure:: ../images/units/03/raster-metadata-cell.png

   Detail of raster metadata.

Raster maps are represented by regular grid. Three data types are
supported:

* CELL (integer)
* FCELL (float)
* DCELL (double)

Vector data
-----------

Let's import sample vector cloud mask data layer from
:file:`sentinel/sample/MSK_CLOUDS_B00.gml` :wikipedia:`GML`
file (commonly used GIS exchange *vector* data format). Vector data can
be imported into GRASS from the toolbar |grass-vector-import|
:sup:`Import vector data [v.import]` or from the menu
:menuselection:`File --> Import vector data --> Simplified vector
import with reprojection`).

.. figure:: ../images/units/03/import-vector-dialog.png

   Select input vector file to be imported.

.. figure:: ../images/units/03/display-band4-clouds.png
   :class: large

   Imported vector data is automatically displayed in *Map Display*
   window. Progress of import is shown in :item:`Console` tab.
   Map composition of Sentinel-2 4th band and cloud mask features.

Notes
-----

.. important:: If a spatial reference system (SRS) of raster/vector
   file differs from GRASS location (:item:`Project match`) input data
   is automatically reprojected into SRS of the current GRASS
   location. Note that GRASS simply does not support on the fly
   transformation from several reasons.

.. _import-no-srs:

.. note:: In some cases SRS of imported file can be missing or
   invalid. GRASS reports this issue as *In case of no
   significant differences in the projection definitions, use
   the -o flag to ignore them and use current location
   definition.  Consider generating a new location from the
   input dataset using the 'location' parameter.*

   GRASS allows importing such file by overriding project check
   (if you are really sure that SRS of input file is the same
   as GRASS location).

.. _vector-topo-section:

Vector topology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's take a closer look at vector metadata of imported administrative
regions. Instead of "polygons" there are "areas" and other kind of
primitives (points, lines, boundaries, centroids, isles), see
:numref:`vector-metadata`.

.. _vector-metadata:

.. figure:: ../images/units/03/vector-metadata-features.png

   Vector metadata of imported file.

GRASS GIS is a **topological GIS**. Importing vector data into GRASS also
means converting features from simple feature model (points,
linestrings, polygons, ...) into GRASS topological model.

.. figure:: ../images/units/03/grass-topo.png
   :class: middle
                    
   GRASS topological model with primitives (nodes, lines,
   boundaries, centroids, areas, and isles).
          
Topological errors are checked and repaired by GRASS GIS when
importing data, be awere of :param:`snap` option of
:grasscmd:`v.import` module. Topological errors which is not possible
repair automatically without user specification can fixed using
:grasscmd:`v.clean` module.

          .. _link-external:

Linking external formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To avoid data duplication GRASS also allows linking raster data using
:grasscmd:`r.external` (*Link external raster data*) and vector data
by :grasscmd:`v.external` (*Link external vector data*) which are also
accessible from the toolbar |grass-layer-import| in :item:`Data` tab.

.. figure:: ../images/units/03/link-data-menu.png
           
   Link raster or vector data.

Linking data is mainly recommended when working with raster data such
large datasets of imagery data. GRASS can handle linked raster data
similarly as native raster maps. Both from point of stability and
accessibility.
