Unit 03 - Data Management
=========================

Data can be imported simply from toolbar by tools dedicated for
:wikipedia:`raster <GIS_file_formats#Raster>` or :wikipedia:`vector
<GIS_file_formats#Vector>` GIS data formats |grass-layer-import|. Basic
knowledge of commonly used :wikipedia:`GIS file formats` is required.

.. note:: GRASS terminology differs from commonly used GIS
          packages. To avoid confusion let's focus on the most
          important terms. Commonly used term "a layer" is called in
          GRASS "a map". GRASS layer is subset of features with one
          "map". So "GRASS raster map" can be treated as "a raster
          layer" in other GIS packages.

Data import
-----------

Data used in this unit is located in :file:`sentinel/sample` directory
of a sample dataset (`download 7z-archive
<http://geo102.fsv.cvut.cz/geoforall/grass-gis-workshop-jena-2018/jena-sample-data.7z>`__).


Raster data
^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's start with :file:`L2A_T32UPB_20170706T102021_B04_10m.jp2`
file. Sentinel's 4th band is a :wikipedia:`JPEG2000` file, which is
nowadays commonly used GIS *raster* format for imagery data.

.. figure:: ../images/units/03/import-raster-toolbar.png

   Import raster data from the main toolbar.

.. note:: Dialog for importing raster data is also accessible from
   menu :menuselection:`File --> Import raster data --> Simplified
   raster import with reprojection` or from command line by
   :grasscmd:`r.import` module.

Import dialog allows importing single vector file (:item:`File`) or
multiple files from directory (:item:`Directory`). In our case single
file is planned to be imported, we keep default data source
(:item:`File`).

.. _import-raster:

.. figure:: ../images/units/03/import-raster-dialog.svg

   Dialog for importing raster file(s).

.. important:: If a spatial reference system (SRS) of raster file
   differs from GRASS location (:item:`Project match`) input raster
   data are automatically reprojected into SRS of current GRASS
   location. Note that GRASS simply does not support on the fly
   transformation from several reasons.

.. _import-no-srs:

.. note:: In some cases SRS of imported file can be missing or
          invalid. GRASS reports this issue as *In case of no
          significant differences in the projection definitions, use
          the -o flag to ignore them and use current location
          definition.  Consider generating a new location from the
          input dataset using the 'location' parameter.*

          GRASS allows importing such file by overriding project check
          (if you are really sure that SRS of input file is the same
          as GRASS location).

After successful operation imported data layer should be automatically
displayed in Map Window.
          
.. figure:: ../images/units/03/display-band4.png
   :class: large

   Imported Sentinel band displayed in Map Window. Default grey color
   table is not perfect as you can see, we will enhance color
   interpretation in :ref:`Unit 04 <color-table>`.

.. todo:: why reprojection is performed?
          
.. note:: GRASS imports/links RGB image as separate bands. Color
   composition can be displayed using :grasscmd:`d.rgb`. By
   :grasscmd:`r.composite` it is possible to create color composite as
   a new raster map.
   
.. _raster-metadata:
  
Basic raster metadata can be printed by :grasscmd:`r.info` or from
Layer Manager contextual menu.

.. figure:: ../images/units/03/raster-metadata.png

   Display raster map metadata from Layer Manager.

.. figure:: ../images/units/03/raster-metadata-cell.png

   Raster metadata of imported file.

Raster maps are represented by regular grid. Three different data
types are supported:

* CELL (integer)
* FCELL (float)
* DCELL (double)
            
Vector data
^^^^^^^^^^^

Cloud mask is stored in :file:`MSK_CLOUDS_B00.gml` :wikipedia:`GML`
file, which is a commonly used GIS exchange *vector* format.

.. figure:: ../images/units/03/import-vector-toolbar.png

   Import vector data from the main toolbar.

.. note:: Dialog for importing vector data is also accessible from
   menu :menuselection:`File --> Import vector data --> Simplified
   vector import with reprojection` or from command line by
   :grasscmd:`v.import` module.
   
.. figure:: ../images/units/03/import-vector-dialog.png

   Dialog for importing vector file(s).

.. note:: In some cases SRS of imported file can be missing or
          invalid. This is our case. GRASS reports this issue as *In
          case of no significant differences in the projection
          definitions, use the -o flag to ignore them and use current
          location definition.  Consider generating a new location
          from the input dataset using the 'location' parameter.*

          GRASS allows importing such file by overriding project check
          (if you are really sure that SRS of input file is the same
          as GRASS location).

          .. figure:: ../images/units/03/override-projection-check.svg

             Override projection check to force import.

After successful operation imported data layer should be automatically
displayed in map window.
   
.. figure:: ../images/units/03/display-band4-clouds.png
   :class: large
   
   Map composition of Sentinel band and cloud mask features.

Vector metadata can be printed similarly to raster from Layer Manager
by :item:`Metadata` or using :grasscmd:`v.info` module from console.

.. _grass-topo:

Vector topology
---------------

Let's take a closer look at vector metadata of imported administrative
regions. Instead of "polygons" there are "areas" and other kind of
primitites (points, lines, boundaries, centroids, isles), see
:numref:`vector-metadata`.

.. _vector-metadata:

.. figure:: ../images/units/03/vector-metadata-features.png

   Vector metadata of imported file.

GRASS GIS is a **topological GIS**. Importing vector data into GRASS also
means converting features from simple feature model (points,
linestrings, polygons, ...) into GRASS topological model.

.. figure:: ../images/units/03/grass7-topo.png
   :class: middle
                    
   GRASS topological model with primitives (nodes, lines,
   boundaries, centroids, areas, and isles).
          
Topological errors are checked and repaired by GRASS GIS when
importing data, be awere of :param:`snap` option of
:grasscmd:`v.import` module. Topological errors which is not possible
repair automatically without user specification can fixed using
:grasscmd:`v.clean` module.

.. _link-external:

Linking external formats
------------------------

To avoid data duplication GRASS also allows linking raster data using
:grasscmd:`r.external` (*Link external raster data*) and vector data
by :grasscmd:`v.external` (*Link external vector data*).

.. figure:: ../images/units/03/link-data-menu.png

   Link raster or vector data from Layer Manager.

Linking data is mainly recommended when working with raster data such
large datasets of imagery data. GRASS can handle linked raster data
similarly as native raster maps. Both from point of stability and
accessibility.

GUI dialog for data linking is the same as for import, see
:numref:`import-raster`. Let's create a link to 8th Sentinel band JP2
file.

From metadata it is clear than 4th band was imported into native GRASS
format, while 8th band was linked directly from original JPEG2000
format.

.. figure:: ../images/units/03/raster-linked.png

   Linked raster file in external GRASS format by :grasscmd:`r.external`.

.. figure:: ../images/units/03/raster-imported.png

   Imported raster file in native GRASS format by
   :grasscmd:`r.in.gdal` (or :grasscmd:`r.import`).

.. todo:: r.colors is needed! + link visualization is slow
