Unit 23 - Spatio-temporal parallelization
=========================================

This unit is focused on improving script created in :doc:`22` by
processing Sentinel scenes in parallel. The paralelization is done by
:pygrass-modules:`ParallelModuleQueue`, see line :lcode:`217`
similarly to :doc:`19`.

New feature of PyGRASS library is introduced on line :lcode:`146`. By
:pygrass-modules:`MultiModule` you can define list of modules which
will work as isolated units not influenced by other processes running
parallel. By setting ``set_temp_region`` the computation region
settings will be not influenced by other processes running in
parallel.

The option :param:`ncproc` on line :lcode:`43` enables controlling
number of processes running in parallel.
