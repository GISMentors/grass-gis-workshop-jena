Unit 23 - ST script tuning
==========================

Let's improve script created in :doc:`22` by processing Sentinel
scenes in parallel. The paralelization is done by
:pygrass-modules:`ParallelModuleQueue`, see line :lcode:`237`
similarly to :doc:`19`.

New feature of PyGRASS library is introduced on line :lcode:`166`. By
:pygrass-modules:`MultiModule` you can define list of modules which
will work as separated units not influenced by other processes running
parallel. By ``set_temp_region`` we ensure that computation region
settings will not influenced by other processes running in parallel.

New script option :param:`ncproc` on line :lcode:`48` enables
controlling number of processes running in parallel.
