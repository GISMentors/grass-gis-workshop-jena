Unit 10 - Python intro
======================

:wikipedia-en:`Python` programming/scripting language is very popular
in the field of GIS (and a science in general). Python is also main
scripting platform for Esri product (see `arcpy
<http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/arcpy/get-started/what-is-arcpy-.htm>`__
package). GRASS is not an exception. GRASS Pythonic environment
includes various libraries (see :grasscmd2:`GRASS documentation
<libpython/index.html>`). We will focus on three libraries which
relates to this workshop:

* :grasscmd2:`GRASS Scripting Library <libpython/script_intro.html>`
  as entering node to Python scripting in GRASS
* object-oriented fancy :grasscmd2:`pyGRASS
  <libpython/pygrass_index.html>`
* space-temporal :grasscmd2:`GRASS GIS Temporal Framework
  <libpython/temporal_framework.html>`

Let's do our first steps from safe GRASS GUI environment which we
already know. Switch in Layer Manager to :item:`Python` tab.

   Python shell in Layer Manager.
            
Let's try simple computation workflow:

#. Set computation extent to Jena city region, align region to Sentinel bands
#. Extend computation region by 1km offset
#. Set mask based on cloud vector map
#. Compute NDVI index
#. Compute NDVI values statistics, print min, max and mean NDVI values
