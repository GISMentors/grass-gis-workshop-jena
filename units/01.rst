Unit 01 - About GRASS GIS
=========================

**GRASS GIS**, commonly referred to as GRASS (Geographic Resources
Analysis Support System), is a free and open-source Geographic
Information System (GIS) software suite used for geospatial data
management and analysis, image processing, graphics and maps
production, spatial modelling, and visualization. GRASS GIS is
currently used in academic and commercial settings around the world,
as well as by many governmental agencies and environmental consulting
companies. It is a founding member of the Open Source Geospatial
Foundation (`OSGeo <http://www.osgeo.org>`__).

Originally developed by the U.S. Army Construction Engineering
Research Laboratories (USA-CERL, 1982-1995, see history of GRASS
1.0-4.2 and 5beta), a branch of the US Army Corp of Engineers, as a
tool for land management and environmental planning by the military,
GRASS GIS has evolved into a powerful utility with a wide range of
applications in many different areas of applications and scientific
research (source: https://grass.osgeo.org).

In a nutshell
-------------

**Advantages**:

* open source -- you can use it freely, modify, improve, share
* a strong user community, commercial support
* large scale functionality, a large amount of tools (2D/3D
  raster/vector, topology, imagery, map production, spatio-temporal
  data, ...)
* both GUI and CMD (easy-to-use for scripting) user interface
* Python API and libraries

**Disadvantages** (turning out to be advantages in some cases):

* open-source ;-)
* complicated for newcomers (we solved it in GRASS 8 ;-))
* native data format (requires importing data, be aware of the possibility
  of linking external formats)
* vector topology (confusing for GIS beginners, sometimes tricky to
  import broken GIS data)

**When to use GRASS GIS?**

* doing data analysis
* working with topological vector data
* working with a large amount of data
* analysing spatio-temporal data
* doing Python scripting
* deploying server-side applications (see `actinia
  <https://www.osgeo.org/projects/actinia/>`__ project for example)
* *add your point here...*
  
**When to use rather something else?**

* want to visualize geodata in an easy and quick way (use QGIS instead)
* want to access simple features
* being scared of location and mapsets ;-)
* *add your point here...*

How to install
--------------

GNU/Linux
^^^^^^^^^

See https://grass.osgeo.org/download/software/linux/

Example for Debian/Ubuntu OS:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install grass

.. tip:: More recent versions of GRASS are available via `UbuntuGIS PPA
   <https://launchpad.net/~ubuntugis/+archive/ubuntu/ubuntugis-unstable>`__.
   
MS Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

See https://grass.osgeo.org/download/software/ms-windows/

There are basically two options:

#. Traditional standalone installer
#. OSGeo4W network installer

.. tip:: GRASS GIS is also part of the `QGIS installer on Windows
   <https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html>`__. So if QGIS is
   already installed on your machine, you don't have to install GRASS
   GIS separately.
