Unit 01 - About GRASS GIS
=========================

**GRASS GIS**, commonly referred as GRASS (Geographic Resources
Analysis Support System), is a free and open source Geographic
Information System (GIS) software suite used for geospatial data
management and analysis, image processing, graphics and maps
production, spatial modeling, and visualization. GRASS GIS is
currently used in academic and commercial settings around the world,
as well as by many governmental agencies and environmental consulting
companies. It is a founding member of the Open Source Geospatial
Foundation (OSGeo).

Originally developed by the U.S. Army Construction Engineering
Research Laboratories (USA-CERL, 1982-1995, see history of GRASS
1.0-4.2 and 5beta), a branch of the US Army Corp of Engineers, as a
tool for land management and environmental planning by the military,
GRASS GIS has evolved into a powerful utility with a wide range of
applications in many different areas of applications and scientific
research. (source: https://grass.osgeo.org)

In Nutshell
-----------

**Advantages**:

* open source, you can use it freely, modify, improve, share
* strong user community, commercial support
* large scale functionality, large amount of tools (2D/3D
  raster/vector, topology, imagery, map production, spatio-temporal
  data, ...)
* both GUI and CMD (easy for scripting)
* Python API and libraries

**Disadvantages** (turning out to be advantages in some cases):

* open source ;-)
* complicated for newcomers
* native data format (requires importing data, be aware of possibility
  of linking external formats)
* topology (not a good idea to link external vector formats)

**When to use GRASS GIS?**

* doing data analysis
* working with topological vector data
* analysing spatio-temporal data
* doing Python scripting
* deploying server-side applications (e.g. as WPS processes)
* *add your point here...*
  
**When to use rather something else?**

* want to vizualize geodata in easy and quick way (use QGIS instead)
* quick access to vector data (simple features)
* being scared of location and mapsets ;-)
* *add your point here...*

Installation
------------

GNU/Linux
^^^^^^^^^

See https://grass.osgeo.org/download/software/linux/

Example for Ubuntu OS:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install grass

.. tip:: More recent versions of GRASS are available via `UbuntuGIS PPA
   <https://launchpad.net/~ubuntugis/+archive/ubuntu/ubuntugis-unstable>`__.
   
MS Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

See https://grass.osgeo.org/download/software/ms-windows/

There are basically two options:

* **OSGeo4W network installer**
* **traditional standalone installer**

.. tip:: On Windows GRASS GIS is also part of QGIS installation!
