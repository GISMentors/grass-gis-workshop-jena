Unit 28 - PyWPS LST point stats
===============================

A second version of the WPS process will return LST statistics for
given point in Germany (referenced in :epsg:`3035`). Input parameters
are defined on lines :lcode:`10, 12, 14`. The output is defined as
:wikipedia:`JSON`, see line :lcode:`17`.

The pixel extraction is done by :grasscmd:`t.rast.what` on line
:lcode:`62`. Statistics is computed based on command output somehow
manually on lines :lcode:`73-96`. Resultant Python dictionary is
converted to JSON structure using ``json`` Python library on line
:lcode:`98`.

Do not forget to import process as done in :ref:`Unit 27
<process-import>` and restart demo PyWPS server.

Try to improve the process in order to validate coordinates. Only
point located in Germany is allowed.
