Unit 28 - PyWPS LST point stats
===============================

Second version of our WPS process will return LST statistics for given
point in Germany (referenced in :epsg:`3035`). Input parameters are
defined on lines :lcode:`10, 12, 14`. The output is defined as
:wikipedia-en:`JSON`, see line :lcode:`17`.

The pixel extraction is done by :grasscmd:`t.rast.what` on line
:lcode:`62`. Statistics is computed based on command output somehow
manually on lines :lcode:`73-96`. Resultant Python dictionary is
converted to JSON structure using ``json`` Python library on line
:lcode:`98`.
