Unit 19 - DTM script parallelization
====================================

This unit is focused on **computing parallelization**. Sample script
below produces seamless DTM (Digital Terrain Model, see :doc:`18`)
from bunch of LAS/LAZ files. Computation will be split into tiles and
performed in parallel.

DTM interpolation in parallel
-----------------------------

User interface contains two major parameters, :param:`directory` (line
:lcode:`6`) for input directory with input LAS/LAZ files, and
:param:`elevation` (line :lcode:`9`) name for output elevation raster
map mosaics. The resolution of output DTM is defined by
:param:`resolution` parameter (line :lcode:`13`). And finally number
of processes running in parallel will be controlled by :param:`nproc`
(line :lcode:`18`) parameter.

A script consists of three main functions:

1. ``import_files()`` to import input LAS/LAZ files (line
:lcode:`33`). Import process can be done in parallel by
:pygrass-modules:`ParallelModuleQueue` from PyGRASS library (see
:doc:`11` for PyGRASS introduction), lines :lcode:`37, 42, 57-58, 60`.

2. ``create_dtm_tiles()`` to compute DTM per tile (line :lcode:`67`)
using :grasscmd:`v.surf.rst`. DTM tiles need to be computed with a
reasonable overlap in order to create seamless mosaics, see
:lcode:`73-76`. Tiles can be processed in parallel too, see
:param:`nproc` option on line :lcode:`82`.

3. ``patch_tiles()`` to patch DTM tiles together by
:grasscmd:`r.series`, see :lcode:`86`. From overlapping cell values is
computed an average value. This is main reason why :grasscmd:`r.patch`
is not used here.

Sample script to download: `create-dtm.py <../_static/scripts/create-dtm.py>`__

.. note::

	The script is taking a long time with all the tiles from
	:file:`/home/user/geodata/lidar` directory. Choose few tiles
	for testing.

	Create a new directory eg. :file:`/tmp/lidar` and link some (2
	or 3) of the LAZ files with
	
	.. code-block:: bash
		
		ln -s /home/user/geodata/lidar/las_681_5644_1_th_2014-2019.laz /tmp/lidar/

	Use :file:`/tmp/lidar` as :option:`input` in the :file:`create-dtm.py` script

DTM comparision
---------------

In this session we are going to calculate the Canopy Height Model
(CHM), as the difference between interpolated DSM and imported EU-DEM
DTM from :doc:`15`.

The CHM is computed using :grasscmd:`r.mapcalc`, executing the difference between
DSM and DTM

.. code-block:: bash

   r.mapcalc expression="chm = dtm_laz - dem"

.. figure:: ../images/units/19/chm.png
