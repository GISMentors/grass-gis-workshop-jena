Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
====================================

   FOSS software overview (`source
   <https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/open-source-software-development-neha-sharma>`__).

Free and open-source software (FOSS) is computer software that can be
classified as both **free software** and **open-source
software**. That is, anyone is freely licensed to

* use,
* copy,
* study, and
* change

the software in any way, and the source code is openly shared so that
people are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the
software. This is in contrast to **proprietary software**, where the
software is under restrictive copyright and the source code is usually
hidden from the users. See :wikipedia-en:`Free and open-source
software` article on Wikipedia for details.

FOSS for Geospatial
-------------------

Since 2006 there is `OSGeo Foundation <http://www.osgeo.org>`__ to
support the collaborative development of open source geospatial
software, and promote its widespread use.

The foundation has adopted principles to ensure that projects under
OSGeo umbrella will satisfy basic quality requirements, namely:

* Projects should manage themselves, striving for consensus and
  encouraging participation from all contributors - from beginning
  users to advanced developers.
* Contributors are the scarce resource and successful projects court
  and encourage them.
* Projects are encouraged to adopt open standards and collaborate with
  other OSGeo projects.
* Projects are responsible for reviewing and controlling their code
  bases to insure the integrity of the open source baselines.

This principles ensure that `OSGeo projects
<https://www.osgeo.org/projects/>`__ are well established, stable,
mature and sustainable.

Software used in this training materials
========================================

* `GRASS GIS <http://grass.osgeo.org>`__ for geospatial (raster,
  imagery, vector) data processing and providing spatial analysis.
* `QGIS desktop <http://qgis.org>`__ for geospatial visualization,
  creating hardcopy outputs, and publishing.
* `GDAL library <http://gdal.org>`__ for reading and writing various
  geospatial data (GeoTIFF, JPEG, Shapefile, GML, ...).
